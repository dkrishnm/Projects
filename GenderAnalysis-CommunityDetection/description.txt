In this project, data collected is for the five twitter accounts to perform community detection  and
gender analysis on the followers. The five seed users are:
      Java,Java_EE, ThePSF, R_Programming, DatascienceCtrl
The above accounts where chosen to determine how the programming languages Java, R, Python are used in data science
and web development domains and how these communities are related .
Also I was interested in knowing the male-female percentage in the computer science/ programming areas.

Implementation details:
Collect.py
Output-Users.pkl, followers.pkl,friends.pkl,male_names.pkl,female_names.pkl
Followers and Friends of the above accounts are collected to build the network graph. The data dump of the users,followers and the friends
are created which is used in the analysis henceforth.Due to twitter rate limits, the data collection is restricted to a count of 100.
US census data is collected and a dump is created to perform gender analysis.

Cluster.py.
Output - BeforeClustering.png , AfterClustering.png
Clustering is done on the network created using the above.Before the partitioning is performed, the communities Java- Java EE,
Rprogramming-DatascienceCtrl is found to have more number of shared users.
Partition is performed using Girvan- Newman algorithm
Five communities where discovered using partitioning with average number of users per community 95.2, which finds the communities to have a good balance


Classify.py
Output- Classified followers.
Classification is done based on the gender of the followers.Using the census data preliminary matching of the followers is done.
Description of mentioned users with text is used as features to predict gender. Logistic regression model is used to fit and predict on the model
From the gender prediction it could be found that the number of male users is much greater than the female users for these accounts,
which indicates more males in the programming domain
